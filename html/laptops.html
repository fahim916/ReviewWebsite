	<h4>Some mandatory specs:</h4>
      <li>SSD (Solid State Drive)</li>
	  <li>GPU (At least Nvidia MX130 4gb)</li>
	  <li>CPU (At least 8th gen Core i5)</li>
	  <li>Display size (We recommend 15")</li>
	  <li>RAM 8gb</li>
	  <hr>
	<h4>Why do we need SSD?</h4>
	<p>SSD is the component which can read and write significantly faster than HDD. It also helps to install and run the games faster. It makes the boot time significantly faster. So overall people get smoother and faster experience eventhough they have crappy CPU and GPU.</p>
    <hr>
	<h4>Does display size matter?</h4>
	<p> Display size is totally based on people's opinion and what they prefer personally. Since we are concentrating more on lightweight portable gaming laptop then 13 inch is perfect. But if your purpose is only about playing games then 15 inch is a very good size for it.</p>
	<hr>
	<h4> What GPU is the best?</h4>
	<p>GPU plays a big role in gaming. Big games like Assasin's creed, Watch Dog, GTA V needs better GPU with more Video Ram such as Nvidia GTX 1050ti and Nvidia GTX 1060.
	Games like Fortnite, PUBG, FIFA 18, CSGO, and Dota 2 does not need better and expensive GPU. The new and cheapest Nvidia MX150 can handle those game easily. 
	So, choosing GPU is also based on people's opinion and based on their preferable games.</a></p>
	<hr>
	<h4>What CPU is the best choice?</h4>
	<p>There are many expensive laptop CPUs such as Intel core i7 8th gen 8750H  and Intel core i9 8950hk that can handle games and streaming at the same time. But some people cannot afford these expensive CPUs. So our recommendation is to get the latest core i5 8th gen 8300H CPU. It is a very powerful cpu and slightly better than the previous generation's i7 7700hq. It is also inexpensive compare to 7700hq which gives it a great value. So in terms of CPU choice, it is based on how much people can afford.</p>
	<hr>
	<h4>Conclusion</h4>
	<p>In conclusion, buying a lightweight laptop that can run every games is expensive. Based on our recommendation there are many inexpensive laptops that has the same specs we provided and can run games like Fortnite, PUBG, FIFA 18, Dota 2, and CSGO.</p>
